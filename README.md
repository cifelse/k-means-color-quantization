# K-means Color Quantization
A simple Web Application based on the k-means algorithm for color image quantization, allowing users to upload images and select the number of colors for optimal color representation. With options to choose color spaces, cluster center initialization methods, and distance metrics, users can easily enhance and simplify the color quantization process for their images. This project is for the partial fulfillment of the requirements for the course DIGIMAP in De La Salle University.
